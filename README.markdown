# Sublime Text 2 plugin: svn

Svn integration: it's pretty handy. Who knew, right?

For more information about what's supported, and how to install this, [check the wiki](https://svnhub.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-svn/wiki).

## Install

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Select Svn when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Svn up to date with the latest version.

### The rest

If you don't want to use Package Control, [check the wiki](https://svnhub.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-svn/wiki) for other installation methods on various platforms.
